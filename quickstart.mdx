## How to generate permanent token

The default whatsapp tokens expire after a few hours as they are normally used for testing. You need to create a permanent token instead if you don’t want this. Follow these steps to create a permanent access token for your WhatsApp Business account:

1. Sign into the Meta Business Suite https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-business-suite.
2. Select your business account in the top-left dropdown menu and click its Settings(gear) icon.
3. Navigate to Users > System users.
4. Click the Add button and accept it.
5. In the Create system user dialog box, fill in the System username section.
6. Then select the System user role as ‘Admin’ and click the Create system user button.
<Warning>
This step is only necessary if an admin user has not already been created. If an admin user already exists, you can use this for token generation.
</Warning>
7. On the same page, click the Assign Assets button.
8. Proceed to Select asset type, click on Apps from the left, and select assets from the list of available apps.
9. Enable the Full control toggle button for managing your app and click the Assign assets button.
10. Click the Generate token button.
11. Select the desired app from the dropdown (Select App) and click Next.
12. Set the token expiration period and click Next.
13. Scroll to Assign Permissions and select whatsapp_business_messaging and whatsapp_business_management from the list. Click the Generate Token button at the bottom.
14. Copy the Token and paste it to the WhatsApp Token field on the Swiftchats Whatsapp Configuration page.
