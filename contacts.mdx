## Bulk Import

Quickly import multiple contacts at once using a CSV or Excel file. The import process automatically includes all your configured dynamic contact fields, ensuring comprehensive data import.
​
## Step 1: Download the Import Template

Before importing contacts, you should download the import template which includes all your configured dynamic contact fields:
1. Navigate to the Contacts page
2. Click on Import Contacts
3. Click Download Template to get the latest template with your current dynamic contact fields

<Info>Important: Always download the template before importing to ensure you have the latest dynamic contact fields as configured in your settings.</Info>

## Step 2: Required Column Mapping

The template will include these standard fields plus your custom dynamic contact fields:

Standard Fields:

- First name (Required)
- Last name
- Phone (Required) — Must start with the country code
- Email
- Group name
- Street
- City
- State
- Zip
- Country

Dynamic Contact Fields:

- All custom fields you’ve configured in Settings > Contact Fields will automatically appear as columns in the template
<Info>If a group name does not already exist, it will be created automatically. To assign a contact to multiple groups, separate the group names in the same cell using a pipe symbol (|).Example: Group 1 | Group 2​</Info>
## Step 3: Import Process

1. Fill in your contact data using the downloaded template
2. Save the file as CSV or Excel format
3. Upload the file through the import interface
4. Review the import summary showing successful and failed imports
