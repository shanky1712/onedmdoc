This section allows customers to manage their subscription plans and make payments conveniently and view their billing history.
​
## Upgrading or Downgrading Plans
Customers have the flexibility to upgrade or downgrade their plans at any time. If changes are made during an active billing period, they will only be charged a prorated amount for the remaining period.
For example, if a customer subscribes to a plan and decides to switch to another plan in the middle of the month, they will only pay for the remaining days of that month.
​
## Email Payment Reminders
Your customers will receive email payment reminders if they fail to renew their subscriptions.
